				<p>Ethiopia's Coffee Sayings, Coffee Origin Myth, Coffee History and More
					<br>
					Ethiopia is considered to be the birthplace of the coffee plant and of coffee culture.
					It is thought that coffee was discovered in Ethiopia as long ago as
					the ninth century. Today, over 12 million people in Ethiopia are
					involved in the cultivation and picking of coffee, and coffee remains a central part of Ethiopian
					culture.
					<br>

				<h1 id="second">Ethiopian Coffee Expressions</h1>
				<p>The most popular legend of coffee in Ethiopia usually goes something like this: Kaldi, an Abyssinian
					goat herder from Kaffa, was herding his goats through a highland area near a monastery. He noticed
					that they were behaving very strangely that day, and had begun to jump around in an excited manner,
					bleating loudly and practically dancing on their hind legs. He found that the source of the
					excitement was a small shrub (or, in some legends, a small cluster of shrubs) with bright red
					berries. Curiosity took hold and he tried the berries for himself.
					<br>
					Like his goats, Kaldi felt the energizing effects of the coffee cherries. After filling his pockets
					with the red berries, he rushed home to his wife, and she advised him to go to the nearby monastery
					in order to share these "heaven-sent" berries with the monks there.
					<br>
					Upon arrival at the monastery, Kaldi's coffee beans were not greeted with elation, but with disdain.
					One monk called Kaldi's bounty "the Devil's work" and tossed it into a fire. However, according to
					legend, the aroma of the roasting beans was enough to make the monks give this novelty a second
					chance. They removed the coffee beans from the fire, crushed them to put out the glowing embers, and
					covered them with hot water in an ewer in order to preserve them (or so the story goes).
					<br>
					All the monks in the monastery smelled the aroma of the coffee and came to try it out. Much like the
					tea-drinking Buddhist monks of China and Japan, these monks found that coffee's uplifting effects
					were beneficial in keeping them awake during their spiritual practice (in this case, prayer and holy
					devotions). They vowed that from then on they would drink this newfound beverage each day as an aid
					to their religious devotions.
					<br>
					There is an alternate coffee origin myth, which attributes the discovery of coffee to a very devout
					Muslim man named Sheikh Omar who was living as a recluse in Mocha, Yemen.
					<br>
					<hr>
				</p>
				<h1 id="third">Ethiopian Coffee History</h1>
				<p>It is thought that the legendary character of Kaldi would have existed around 850 A.D. This account
					coincides with the commonly held belief that coffee cultivation began in Ethiopia around the ninth
					century. However, some believe that coffee was cultivated as early as 575 A.D. in Yemen.
					<br>
					Although the legend of Kaldi, his goats, and the monks say that coffee was discovered as a stimulant
					and as a beverage on the same day, it is far more likely that coffee beans were chewed as a
					stimulant for centuries before they were made into a beverage. It is likely that the beans were
					ground and mixed with ghee (clarified butter) or with animal fat to form a thick paste, which was
					rolled into small balls then consumed as needed for energy on long journeys. Some historians believe
					that this custom of chewing coffee beans was brought (along with coffee itself) from Kaffa to Harrar
					and Arabia by enslaved Sudanese who chewed coffee to help survive the arduous journeys of the Muslim
					slave trade routes. Supposedly, enslaved Sudanese picked up this custom of chewing coffee from the
					Galla nation of Ethiopia. Today, the tradition of consuming ground coffee in ghee remains in some
					areas of Kaffa and Sidamo. Similarly, in Kaffa, some people add a little melted clarified butter to
					their brewed coffee to make it more nutritionally dense and to add flavor (a bit like the butter
					pu-erh tea of Tibet).
					<br>
					According to some sources, there was also a way of eating coffee as a porridge, and this method of
					consuming coffee could be seen amongst several other indigenous nations of Ethiopia around the tenth
					century.
					<br>
					Gradually, coffee became known as a beverage in Ethiopia and beyond. In some populations, coffee
					cherries were crushed and then fermented into a kind of wine. In others, coffee beans were roasted,
					ground, and then boiled into a decoction. Gradually, the custom of brewing coffee took hold and
					spread elsewhere. Around the 13th century, coffee spread to the Islamic world, where it was revered
					as potent medicine and powerful prayer aid and was boiled much like medicinal herbal decoctions are
					boiled—for intensity and strength. You can still find traditions of boiling coffee in Ethiopia,
					Turkey, and much of the rest of the Mediterranean, where they are known as Ethiopian coffee, Turkish
					coffee, Greek coffee and other, similar names.

				<h1 id="fourth">The Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony</h1>
				<p>The Ethiopian coffee ceremony is central to the communities of many Ethiopian villages. You can read
					more about this in the article The Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony.

				</p>
				<h1 id="fifth">The Etymology of Coffee</h1>
				<p>
					In the local language, the word for coffee is "bunn" or "buna". The origin of coffee is Kaffa. So
					coffee was sometimes referred to as "Kaffa bunn," or coffee from Kaffa. For this reason, some
					believe that the term "coffee bean" is an anglicization of "Kaffa bunn". Given that coffee beans are
					actually berries, this theory makes even more sense.
